Start in the woods. "Fuck man, I really need to get to school." 

Walk through the woods. lots of different details present. Toward the end of the level, the weather starts to get really cloudy.

"Ugh, really??? Why don't I ever look up the weather before I leave the house?? Hopefully I can make to class before it starts raining."

When you reach the end of the level, lightning strikes the ground at the player. The screen goes black. 






















<<What? The fuck happened. wait......>>

<<I was in the forest. Where am I??>>

<<Uhhh.... where is my BODY?!?!?>>
<<Nows probably a good time to start freaking out!>>

A scene starts to form. You are in a house. Not your own, but you recognize the photos on the wall.
<<Ellen....>> 

Sounds come from outside the room.

"Why don't you just call her??"

"Because! It's.... it's been too long already."

A girl enters the room.

(too herself) "Besides, she probably hates me after leaving her all those years ago."
              "I'm so sorry Kat.... I wish I could tallk to you right now!"
     
<<I'm right here! I don't hate you! I miss you!>>

Ellen does not respond but goes to her bed and starts to cry as the scene fades to black again.

<<Why?? What is going on??>>

A new scene appears. A hospital room becomes visible.
