Like life is strange but better, because in the end you actually get the girl.

Start in the woods. "Fuck man, I really need to get to school." 

Walk through the woods. lots of different details present. Toward the end of the level, the weather starts to get really cloudy.

"Ugh, really??? Why don't I ever look up the weather before I leave the house?? Hopefully I can make to class before it starts raining."
